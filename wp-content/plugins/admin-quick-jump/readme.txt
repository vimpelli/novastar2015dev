Admin Quick Jump adds a dropdown list to the admin edit-post area. This allows you to quickly jump to other draft and published posts/pages.

== Description ==

Admin Quick Jump is a very simple plugin that adds a dropdown list to the admin edit-post area. The list contains posts of the same post_type as the one you are currently editing, and allows you to quickly jump between other draft and published posts. This is much less time-consuming than navigating back to the posts list and choosing the post you need.

* **Perfect for quickly jumping between editing posts, pages and custom posts.**
* **No plugin settings page required, simply install and activate the plugin.**

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `jck-quick-jump` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or search for **Admin Quick Jump** in your WordPress admin area.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. When you edit a post, page or custom post, you will see a new meta box above the publish meta box. That's it!
